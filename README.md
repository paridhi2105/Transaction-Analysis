# Transaction-Analysis

#THE DATASET IS PROVIDED BY ANZ FOR THE VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE PROGRAM AT INSIDESHERPA AND I HAVE USED IT WITHOUT ANY ALTERATION.

#I have tried to analyze a transaction dataset. It contains 3 monthsâ€™ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. 
#Here is the detailed task description.

#First, try identifying the annual salary for each customer

#Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age). 
#These attributes could be those that are readily available in the data (e.g. age) or those that can be constructed or derived ourselves.
#Visualise any interesting correlations using a scatter plot.

#Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes identified above

#Print the accurate of the model
